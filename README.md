# Login page
### Full stack Java application

Registration, login and logout using Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, Thymeleaf, MySQL, Lombok and Bootstrap 5.

There are many examples on Internet of how to create a login page using Spring Security. However, they mostly use an approach with a deprecated method by extending the class WebSecurity with WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter.
Thus, I decided to update the code according to the lastest Spring documentation.
